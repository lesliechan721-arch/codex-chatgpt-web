Use the ChatGPT Web models available on your account, including Pro, from Codex’s native model picker—with ChatGPT Web’s separate usage limits, without spending your Work or Codex quota. Keep the same interface, tasks, images, and streaming.

Full harness mode connects ChatGPT to the current task’s files, terminal, tools, and approvals through MCP. Conversations stay tied to your Codex task, so you can keep working as the context grows.

<div id="get-started"><a id="quick-start"></a></div>

## Get started

**Available models:** Free/Go → **Luna / Think**. Paid accounts → **GPT-6 Sol** and **GPT-5.6 Sol**, with **Instant–High**, plus **Extra High** and **Pro** when available. Each version has its own entry; existing GPT-5.6 chats keep GPT-5.6. Availability depends on your account and workspace.

1. **Install the launcher** using the download for your system above.
2. **Sign in to ChatGPT** in the embedded browser and run the browser smoke test.
3. **Install models** and restart Codex once. In automatic mode, choose a model ending in **(Web)**. Pro versions have separate entries; Sol reasoning is selected through Effort. Zero Risk keeps its dedicated entry.
4. **For coding with tools**, open **MCP** in the launcher and complete the Full harness setup below.

The app includes its browser and runtime. No separate Chrome, Node, or Bun installation is needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Terminal install, updates & repair</strong></summary>

Quit the launcher before updating. These installers select the platform and architecture, verify the published checksums, and preserve your ChatGPT profile and launcher settings.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/lesliechan721-arch/codex-chatgpt-web/releases/latest/download/install-launcher.sh | sh
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell

<details>
<summary><strong>Models, modes & MCP setup</strong></summary>

<a id="modes"></a>

Automatic modes offer Luna/Think when the account has no reasoning selector; otherwise Instant–High, with Extra High and Pro available independently when exposed by the account.

| Mode | Sending messages | Local Codex tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Browser-only** | Automatic | No |
| **Full harness (With Automation)** | Automatic | Yes, through MCP |
| **Zero Risk** | Paste and send manually | Yes, through a separate MCP connector |

Zero Risk does not read or operate the ChatGPT page. Choose the model and `Codex Zero Risk4` connector yourself, then paste and send the prepared prompt. By default, confirm **Sent** in the launcher after sending. You can disable that second confirmation in Launcher settings or with `--zero-risk-no-sent-confirmation`; in that mode the Sent button is hidden and the connector binding confirms the turn automatically. Required fallback images still need their separate attachment confirmation. Use `--zero-risk-sent-confirmation` to enable the default behavior explicitly. Automatic models ending in **(Web)** expose their supported Effort choices in Codex. Instant and each Pro version have separate entries to preserve their context budgets; older saved model entries keep their original fixed mode.

<a id="full-harness"></a>

### Full harness

Full mode connects ChatGPT's tool calls back to the current Codex task through the official
[OpenAI tunnel-client](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client). The tunnel is outbound: it does
not expose a public IP, open an inbound port, or require router forwarding.

The launcher uses your system proxy for the tunnel. Explicitly configured proxy
environment variables take priority; local connections stay local.

The launcher's **MCP** page guides the complete setup. For the exact clicks, see the
[video walkthroughs](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

> **Limits**
>
> See [Limits](https://github.com/miuuyy/codex-chatgpt-web/discussions/309) for the current
> ChatGPT message allowances for **GPT-5.6 Sol Pro** and **GPT-6 Astra**. Context limits depend on
> the account type and selected effort. Plus Medium/High uses a measured 90,000-token window.
> GPT-5.6 supports up to 270,000 tokens with experimental **3× context** enabled, with native
> Codex compaction supported throughout.
>
> GPT-6 Sol supports Bigger Context at Medium, High and available Extra High: **120,000 tokens
> on Plus**, with compaction at **110,000**, and **240,000 on Pro**, with compaction at **220,000**.
> GPT-6 Instant uses standard context.
> GPT-5.6 and GPT-6 Pro keep their existing Bigger Context limits.

> Luna/Think can opt into experimental multipart Bigger Context. Long Free chats may lose older
> details. With Bigger Context off, Luna keeps its rolling checkpoint. Applicable Full Native + Launcher
> routes use the unified history budget; browser delivery still follows each supported transport.

1. Finish the required setup, open **MCP**, create the Tunnel and regular API key, then press
   **Connect harness**.
2. Enable ChatGPT **Developer Mode** and create a new Tunnel connector named exactly
   **Codex Native5**, with **Authentication: None** and **Allow all actions**.
3. Complete configuration. **Verify runtime** is optional for troubleshooting. When requested,
   it checks the installed schema and requires six successful read-only MCP returns: list, search,
   and read with ordinary and independent compaction credentials. Zero Risk keeps manual plugin
   selection, Send, and its Sent policy. The result describes that check; it does not guarantee a
   later call. Missing or failed historical results do not block tasks, navigation, or compaction.

The current MCP ABI uses **Codex Native5** for Automatic, **Codex Zero Risk4** for Zero Risk, and
**Codex Native5 DEV** for repository development. Preserve **Codex Native4**, **Codex Native4 DEV**,
and **Codex Zero Risk3** and create the corresponding new plugin; never rename or refresh an old
connector. Earlier retired defaults remain retired. Setup preserves custom names that are not
retired defaults. If a custom plugin caches an old schema, choose a new name and create a new
plugin. Production and DEV connectors can remain installed together.

The new ABI adds `codex_context_list`, `codex_context_read`, and `codex_context_search`, including
their independent read-only compaction credential. It retains `codex_tool_wait`,
`codex_task_update_ack`, `task_updates-v1`, and Native `operation_id`; update the runtime and browser
helper together. A new logical Native call uses a new positive integer ID; retries and waits reuse
that ID across reconnects. A pending receipt is not task completion and must not execute the
original operation again.

[Context navigation](docs/context-navigation.md) keeps ordinary task text intact while selected
tool history is read on demand. Images prefer MCP; only required attachment fallbacks need the
extra Zero Risk confirmation. Compaction can inspect a separate read-only source directory without
reading every source. These paths retain existing context limits. Complete release validation is
still pending: limited High-mode multi-image evidence does not establish higher capacity, reliable
number recognition, or stability across all models. See the
[validation scope](docs/release-validation.md#context-navigation-validation).

Write/modify actions also require the ChatGPT workspace and its administrator policy to permit
them. See
[developer mode and MCP apps](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-mcp-apps-in-chatgpt).
Unexpected approval prompts fail closed unless `--auto-approve-tool-calls` is explicitly enabled;
that option clicks **Allow once**, never a permanent grant.

<summary><strong>Diagnostics & subagents</strong></summary>

<a id="operations"></a>

Use **Activity** for safe local diagnostics and **Settings → Run doctor** for end-to-end health.
Settings can also cancel a retained browser turn or remove the Codex integration before uninstall.
**Save chats in ChatGPT** keeps task conversations in ChatGPT history. Off by default; independent of **New browser chat for each turn**.
Set `CODEX_CHATGPT_WEB_BROWSER_DIAGNOSTICS=1` only when every browser checkpoint needs a screenshot.

New installs use **Compatibility V1** for cross-backend subagents. **Native** preserves Codex's own
feature settings and enables plaintext Web-to-Web V2 delegation. Restart Codex and start a new task
after changing the protocol:

```bash
codex-chatgpt-web subagents status
codex-chatgpt-web subagents compatibility-v1
codex-chatgpt-web subagents native
```

<summary><strong>Requirements & security</strong></summary>

<a id="limitations-and-security"></a>

- This is unofficial browser automation, not an OpenAI API. ChatGPT UI changes can break selectors;
  drift fails explicitly instead of silently switching model or transport.
- Browser state is a sensitive login artifact, and the loopback listener is reachable by processes
  running as the same local user. Never share the launcher profile; use a trusted workstation.
- Release packages currently target macOS 13+ (arm64/x64), Windows x64, and Linux x64. Runtime,
  tests, and packaging are gated on all three in CI; account-bound browser and MCP flows use the
  separate [release validation](docs/release-validation.md).
- Builds are not yet platform-signed, so Gatekeeper or SmartScreen may warn. The installers verify
  the published SHA-256 manifest before installation.

Read the complete [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and
[security model](docs/security-model.md) before enabling full mode. Report vulnerabilities through
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Temporary Chat is a [ChatGPT privacy mode](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8914046-temporary-chat-faq); prompts are still processed by OpenAI.

Validation coverage: [release validation](docs/release-validation.md).

This is independent software and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI. Use it only with
your own account and in accordance with applicable [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/)
and workspace policies; it does not bypass authentication or access controls.

<details>
<summary><strong>Run from source & develop</strong></summary>

<a id="development"></a>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lesliechan721-arch/codex-chatgpt-web.git && \
cd codex-chatgpt-web && \
bun run app
```

This source path requires Bun 1.4.2. The command installs locked dependencies and opens the app.

```bash
bun run app
bun run dev:launcher
bun run src/cli.ts dev status
bun run dev:chat compaction-lab "Reply with exactly: DEV READY"
bun run verify
bun run smoke:subagents
bun run app:package
```

`dev:launcher` uses a separate profile and account under `~/.codex-chatgpt-web-dev`. `dev:chat` exercises the real browser and compaction paths with explicit simulated tool results, without changing your normal Codex route. See the [DEV chat harness](docs/dev-chat.md) for setup and commands.

[Session continuity](docs/session-continuity.md) uses one task mechanism on supported Full Native + Launcher routes with ordinary `chatgpt-web/` models. Confirmed live pages retain current-request conflict checks. Closed or unknown pages recover from the current request after best-effort old-execution revocation; old stops, unknown Send/results, checkpoints, and retry budgets cannot block a new page. External work may execute again or continue on an unreachable old page. Closed-page task records are removed, while the independent one-hour `previous_response_id` cache remains. Fresh Conversation Per Turn affects logical sends; Bigger Context and Zero Risk keep existing capabilities and manual-send restrictions. The 1,000,000 / 900,000-token history budget does not enlarge the ChatGPT window. Five physical pages and bounded cleanup still apply. Old-prefix configuration must use the corresponding ordinary name. The guide records outstanding real-platform validation.
